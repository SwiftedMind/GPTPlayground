# GPTPlayground

GPTPlayground is an app that I use as a playground to build AI stuff with OpenAI's API. 
It is using a Swift package I am building: [GPTSwift](https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTSwift).

Feel free to use this app as an inspiration.

> **Note**
> The app is built on an app architecture I am currently developing: [Puddles](https://github.com/SwiftedMind/Puddles).
> It is still a bit experimental. Let me know what you think!

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- iOS 16.3+
- macOS 13.3+

This project was built using the Xcode 14.3 Beta. You might need to use that as well.

## Usage

**You will need to provide your own API key from OpenAI to compile and run the app**

Add a `Keys.plist` file in the project and add a string `OpenAI_API_Key` with your key to the dictionary.
The app's `KeysReader` should find the file as long as it is in your Bundle.
